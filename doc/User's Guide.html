  Suite User's Guide</p>

<h3>1. Overview </h3>

<p class="indent">This validation suite consists of a set of tests modeled after the examples in ISO 
Technical Specification 17961:2013.  There are tools to use these tests with an analyzer, interpreter, or compiler, the 
<a href="#driver">test_driver.sh</a> script and a 
utility that will parse and display the results.  The utility used to parse and display the
results is the <a href="#reporter">reporter</a> and is invoked by the <code>test_driver.sh</code> script.  
There are also several support scripts used to 
generate the <code>testlist.h</code> file, this file is explained in the <a href="#reporter">reporter</a>
section.  There are <code>Makefiles</code> to install, uninstall, and use the tests.  Each rule directory
has a <code>Makefile</code> that will make individual tests, or all of the tests, and remove the files
from building the test(s).</p>

  <h3>2. Installing</h3>
<p class="indent">

  <ol><li> make directory to hold validation suite
  <blockquote>
  <code>mkdir scvs</code>
  </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> change the working directory to the directory that will hold the validation suite
  <blockquote>
  <code>cd scvs</code>
  </blockquote>
  </li>
    <li> unzip
    archive file
    <blockquote>
    <code>gunzip scvs.tar.gz</code>
    </blockquote>
</li>
    <li> extract files from tar ball</li>
<blockquote>
  <code>tar -x scvs.tar</code>
</blockquote>
<li> installing the Suite
<blockquote>
<code>prompt: make install</code>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
</p>
  <h3>3. Suite Layout</h3>
  <p class="indent">
    <table summary="suite layout" cellspacing="10">
    <tr><td valign="top"><code>home</td><td> the top directory, holds the <code>Makefile</code>, <code>index.htm</code>, 
    and the <code>README</code> plus directories explained below</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top"><code>doc</code></td><td> holds the User's Guide, license, and other documents</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top"><code>tools</code></td><td> holds the source to the <code>reporter</code>, 
    some sample command scripts, and utilities needed to
    run the suite, some of these are moved in the tests
    directory during the <code>make install</code> process.</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top"><code>tests</code></td><td>holds the 46 rules directories
    that house the test files, the <code>rule_list</code> file, and after the <code>make install</code>
    process holds the support utilities needed to do a test run</td></tr>

    <tr><td align="top"><code>include</code></td><td>holds the include files for
    the test suite and tools</td></tr>
    </table>
  </p>
  <h3>4. Configuration</h3>
      <p class="indent">Making a command
      file to execute the analyzer that is to be tested, this file
      must be executable, and hold all of the commands needed to
      execute the tool(s) being used and to clean up after or before the tool is executed. For example, 
      the <code>cov_cmds</code> script that is part of the suite is</p>
  <p class="example"># sample command script for Coverity<br>
  #<br>
  if [ -d $1_analyze ]<br>
  then<br>
  rm -rf $1_analyze<br>
  fi<br>
  #<br>
  # step one<br>
  cov-build --dir $1_analyze make -i<br>
  # step two<br>
  cov-analyze --security --concurrency --enable-constraint-fpp --dir $1_analyze<br>
  # step three - information in .out file<br>
  cov-format-errors --dir $1_analyze --emacs-style --functionsort
  &gt; $1.out 2&gt;&amp;1
  </p>
<p class="indent">and the <code>fw_cmds</code> script that is also included with the suite is</p>
<p class="example"># sample command script for the Klocwork<br>
#<br>
if [ -e kwinject.out ]<br>
then<br>
  rm -f kwinject.out<br>
fi<br>
# step one<br>
kwinject make -i<br>
# step two<br>
kwcheck run -b kwinject.out<br>
# step three<br>
kwcheck list &gt; $1.out 2&gt;&amp;1<br>
</p>
<p class="indent"> It is
    important to note here, that the results of the analyzer/tool
    set is the name of the rule passed in as argument 1
    (<code>$1</code>) with an extension
    of <code>.out</code>, this is used by
    the <code>reporter</code> to generate the
    results for the test run. The first part of this script is to
    clean out any left over data from an earlier test run, and is
    unique to this tool set. Also important is that the<code> Makefile</code> for the rule being
    tested is use, <code>make -i</code> is the command that is using the
    <code>Makefile</code>. Each rule
    (directory) has a <code>Makefile</code>, see suite layout. All command scripts should use
    the <code>Makefile</code> if at all possible. If
    the <code>Makefile</code> can not be used, note
    the dependencies in the <code>Makefile</code>. These dependencies
    are important and if not adhered to, the results will not be
    valid.</p>

<h3>5. <a id="driver">Using the <code>test_driver.sh</code> script</a></h3>

<p class="indent">The script <code>test_driver.sh</code> is used to drive the validation suite.  This script write
the configuration used in the test run to the <code>configuration.txt</code> file.  
This <code>configuration.txt</code>
file is used by the <a href="#reporter">reporter</a>.  This test_driver.sh script takes 
several command line options.  The options are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>-l=FILE, --list=FILE</code></dt><dd>	List of directories to test, default is rule_list, 
                        the <code>rule_list</code> file contains all the current test 
                        directories.  Each directory corresponds with a single
                        rule in TS 17961, the rules are also in the same order
                        as they are defined in TS 17961.</dd>
 <dt><code>-s=DIR, --single=DIR</code></dt><dd>	The directory associated with the single rule to test.</dd>
 <dt><code>-c=FILE, --cmd=FILE</code></dt><dd>	The script that holds the commands for the 
                        implementation being tested. Default is default_cmd.  
                        There are several shipped with the test suite that can
                        be used as examples.  See the <code>README</code> file in the top
                        directory, or the User's Guide in the <code>doc</code> directory.</dd>
 <dt><code>-o=FILE, --output=FILE</code></dt><dd>	Put all output to FILE.</dd>
<dt><code>-?, -h, --help</code></dt><dd>	Print a short usage message then exit.</dd>
<dt><code>-V, --version</code></dt><dd>	Print version information then exit.</dd>
 <dt><code>-v, --verbose</code></dt><dd>        Print detailed report of the test run results.</dd>
<dt><code>-d, --debug</code></dt><dd>		Print detailed report, showing all diagnostics found by
                        line number, also sets the verbose flag.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent"> A single rule test run might look like:
<blockquote>
<pre>./test_driver.sh -s=usrfmt -c=cov_cmds 
setting single to usrfmt
setting cmd to cov_cmds

<h3>6. <a id="reporter">The <code>reporter</code> utility</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
The reporter reads in the <code>configuration.txt</code> file to determine the configuration of the test run,
if the <code>configuration.txt</code> file is not readable or missing the reporter will issue a diagnostic and
exit.  A typical <code>configuration.txt</code> file for a single run test the rule <code><b>usrfmt</b></code>
would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre># This file is generated by the SCVS test driver
# This file should not be edited.
#
DATE=Thu Oct 01 01:16:52 PDT 2012
TESTER=benito
TEST_DIRECTORY=/home/benito/Work/scvs/tests
TEST_SCRIPT=cov_cmds
VERSION=0.0B
SINGLE=usrfmt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">The <code>reporter</code> will:</p>
<ol>
<li>read in the contents of this <code>configuration.txt</code> file, setting up the configuration needed to 
look at the results,</li>
<li>open the file defined by <code><b>TEST_DIRECTORY/SINGLE</b>/usrfmt.out</code> that will contain the 
output of the test run.  If more than one rule is tested the file that defined the rules to be tested will
be used to define the output files to use,</li>
<li>scan down the text in this file looking for diagnostic message assocated with the test as defined
in the include file <code>testlist.h</code>,</li>
<li>keep track of all diagnostics found by line number by test file, then</li>
<li>print out the results.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The <code>testlist.h</code> file is generated by the <code>make_testlist.sh</code>, and should not
be edited by hand.  The only time a new <code>testlist.h</code> needes to be regenerated is:</p>
<ol><li>if a test
has been edited changing the line number of the required diagnostic,</li>
<li>if a new test has been added to the suite, or</li>
<li>if a test has bee removed from the suite.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The layout of the
<code>testlist.h</code> is a C structure that holds the rule name, test file, diagnostic line number for
the required diagnostic, a boolean flag set if the test file has been processed, an integer to indicate 
line number found, and a integer to count the number of diagnostic messages found.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
static test_information test_list[] = {
  ...
  
  {"usrfmt","usrfmt_e01.c",87,false,0,0},
  {"usrfmt","usrfmt_e02.c",0,false,0,0},
  {"usrfmt","usrfmt_e03.c",98,false,0,0},
  {"usrfmt","usrfmt_e04.c",0,false,0,0}
  ...
  
  {"","",-1,false,0,0},
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Note, that a '0' in the diagnostic line number indicates that no diagnostic is required.
The <code>-1</code> is used to see the end of the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>7. Building a new <code>testlist.h</code></h3>
<p class="indent">While making a new testlist.h is a single command, it should not be done unless:</p>
<ol>
<li>a test has been removed,</li>
<li>a test has been editted so that the code line where the required diagnostic has been changed, or</li>
<li>a new test(s) have been added to the test suite.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">To build a new <code>testlist.h</code> file type <code>make testlist</code> in the top directory.  This will build a new <code>testlist.h</code> file in the <code>include</code> directory. A <code>make install</code> or a <code>make reporter</code> has to follow the making of a new <code>testlist.h</code> file for the change to take effect.</p>
<h3>8. Cleaning and uninstalling</h3>
<p class="indent">The top <code>Makefile</code> has two targets for cleaning and uninstalling the validation suite.</p>
<dl>
<dt>clean</dt><dd> The clean target will remove all of the scripts copied, the executable generated, and the
sample command scripts copied in <code>tests</code> directory by the <code>make install</code> process.  The <code>configuration.txt</code>
will also be removed.</dd>
<dt>clobber</dt><dd> The clobber target will do a <code>make clean</code>, plus remove all of the test results,
the <code><i>[rules]</i>.out</code> files are removed.</dd>
</dl>
